## About This Project

Hello! I’m Misty Collins — a lifelong technologist and former full-time DBA (SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase) who’s evolved into a multi-disciplinary learner and builder.  

While my professional background is in database administration, I’ve continued exploring every corner of technology — teaching myself **Python, C, and Ruby**, dabbling in **data science**, and even experimenting with **AWS Braket** and **IBM’s quantum simulators** out of fascination with quantum computing.  

This **System Vanguard Codex** is my living workspace — a bridge between traditional DBA mastery and modern-day DevOps, scripting, and security monitoring.  
It’s where I document, test, and share scripts that help track system health, analyze logs, and store insights in Postgres.  

    *Because the best technologists never stop learning — they just keep evolving.*

## Windows vs Linux Workflows — Tuning the System

| Task | Windows (Automatic) | Linux (Manual) |
|------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Shell / Scripting** | PowerShell – intuitive, object-based commands | Bash / Zsh – fast, flexible text pipelines |
| **Python & Packages** | Installers + `pip` in PowerShell | Native `python3`, virtualenvs, `apt` or `dnf` |
| **Database Tools** | pgAdmin, SSMS, GUI clients | `psql`, systemd services, direct config editing |
| **Network Analysis** | Wireshark GUI | `tcpdump`, `tshark`, `iptables`, system logs |
| **System Monitoring** | Task Manager, Event Viewer | `top`, `htop`, `journalctl`, `systemctl` |
| **Security / Hardening** | Defender, Group Policy | `ufw`/`firewalld`, AppArmor/SELinux, auditd |
| **Git & GitHub** | GitHub Desktop / `gh` CLI | `git` + `gh` CLI in terminal |
| **Style** | Comfort and automation | Precision and control |

> *Windows feels like a reliable automatic — perfect for everyday driving.*  
> *Linux feels like a tuned manual — responsive, efficient, and ready for curves.*

## Project Goals

- Build a cross-platform system-health monitoring and logging toolkit.  
- Capture and store system snapshots (services, logs, users, policies) in Postgres.  
- Integrate PowerShell + Python for hybrid automation.  
- Maintain documentation and learning notes in Markdown (Codex format).

## Misty’s Guiding Idea

> *“Technology keeps evolving — and so do we.”*  
> This repo isn’t just code; it’s a personal record of rediscovery, learning, and resilience.  
> Every script and note here represents progress toward independence, confidence, and mastery.
